# About _Writing an OS in Rust_
---
# Writing an OS in Rust: Motivation

- Information scattered across the internet
  - OSDev wiki, x86 manuals, multiboot specification, Rust docs
- Some things not documented at all .grey[(or hard to find)]
  - Rust lang items, target specifications, multiboot 2 with ELF64, correct linker flags, ELF section alignment, etc.
- Most tutorials used old technology
  - Only 32-bit, multiboot 1, no page tables


--
## Goals

- Step-by-step guide
- Provide detailed explanations

---
# Writing an OS in Rust: The Beginnings

- Published in Oct 2015
  - Four posts: A minimal Kernel, Entering Long Mode, Set Up Rust, and Printing to Screen

# Writing an OS in Rust: The Beginnings

Received very positive feedback on [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3q5a7l/get_started_on_writing_an_os_in_rust/):

- “This is a **pretty great introduction** to OS dev! It's a **lot more readable** than many other tutorials I've read.”
- “Thanks so much for your post. When I was toying with my own kernel a while ago, I would get stuck on things like `--gc-sections` for days. I'm really glad to see there's now **a resource on all the hoops you have to go through to boot to Rust**.“

# Open Source Development on GitHub

- Everything is public
  - issues, discussions, work-in-progress features, …
- Everybody can propose changes
  - _Fork_ the repository .grey[(i.e. copy it to your own account)]
  - Perform the changes in your repo .grey[(in a separate branch)]
  - Send a _pull request_ .grey[(PR)]

class: small-slide

# RFC Example: Support for 128bit Integers

- Feature Name: int128
- Start Date: 21-02-2016
- RFC PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1504
- Rust Issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35118

**Summary**

This RFC adds the `i128` and `u128` primitive types to Rust.

**Motivation**

Some algorithms need to work with very large numbers that don't fit in 64 bits, such as certain cryptographic algorithms. One possibility would be to use a BigNum library, but these use heap allocation and tend to have high overhead. LLVM has support for very efficient 128-bit integers, which are exposed by Clang in C as the `__int128` type.

**Detailed design** […]

# Example Contribution: x86-interrupt ABI
The Problem:

```nasm
#[naked]
unsafe extern fn exception_handler_wrapper() {
    asm!("push rax
          […] // push other registers
          push r11
          sub rsp, 8 // align the stack pointer
          call exception_handler
          add rsp, 8 // undo stack pointer alignment
          pop r11
          […] // pop other registers
          pop rax
          iretq
          " :::: "volatile", "intel");
    intrinsics::unreachable();
}
```

---
# Example Contribution: x86-interrupt ABI

Then I saw this PR:

![msp430 interrupts](msp430-interrupts.png)

---
# Example Contribution: x86-interrupt ABI

- Diff very small .grey[(+38 -1)] since LLVM already supports a `msp430-interrupt` ABI


--

- LLVM also supports a `x86-interrupt` ABI!
  - Let's try to add it!

---
# x86-interrupt ABI: Forking

- Fork the Rust repository
  ![fork](fork.png)

- Then you have your own copy:
  ![forked](forked.png)
---
# x86-interrupt ABI: Implementation

- Implement support for the `x86-interrupt` ABI
  - mostly copy&paste of the msp430 PR

```rust
 /// LLVM CallingConv::ID. Should we wrap this?
 #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
 #[repr(C)]
 pub enum CallConv {
     CCallConv = 0,
     FastCallConv = 8,
     […]
     Msp430Intr = 69,
     `X86_Intr = 83`,
  }
```
---
# x86-interrupt ABI: Feature Gate

- Add a feature gate

```rust
impl<'a> PostExpansionVisitor<'a> {
  fn check_abi(&self, abi: Abi, span: Span) {
    match abi {
      […],
      `Abi::X86Interrupt => {`
        `gate_feature_post!(&self, abi_x86_interrupt, span,`
          `"x86-interrupt ABI is experimental and subject to change");`
      `},`
      // Stable
      Abi::Cdecl | Abi::Stdcall | Abi::Fastcall | Abi::Aapcs | Abi::Win64 |
      Abi::Rust | Abi::C | Abi::System => {}
    }
  }
}
```
---
# x86-interrupt ABI: Testing

- Build Rust
  - `python x.py build`
  - Wait a few hours .grey[(on the initial build)]
- Run the test suite
  - `python x.py test`
- Try the new compiler
  - There is a new `rustc` in the build dir
  - Tell `cargo` to use it through the `RUSTC` environment variable
      - e.g. `RUSTC="/home/…/rust/…/rustc" cargo build`

---
# x86-interrupt ABI: Pull Request

- Send a pull request to Rust's master branch

# Multitasking

---
# Multitasking: Principles

- Multiple threads of execution
  - Each thread requires its own stack
- Switch between threads, so that all make progress
  - A _scheduler_ decides which thread runs next
--


## Preemptive Scheduling

- Set up a hardware timer
  - Sends an _interrupt_ after specific time
- CPU invokes interrupt handler .grey[(defined in the IDT)]
  - Calls _dispatcher_ to perform thread switch
      - Calls scheduler to select next thread

---
# Multitasking: Hardware Interrupts

Two interrupt controllers on x86:

- 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)
  - since 1976.grey[, but still present on modern CPUs]
  - limited number of IRQs
  - no multi-processor support


- Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC)
  - since ~1990
  - separation: local APIC and I/O APIC
  - supports inter-processor interrupts (IPIs)
  - supports IRQ priorities
  - built-in timer

---
# 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)

Structure:

.center[![](pic-design.svg)]

---
# PIC Initialization

Save and restore interrupt masks:

```nasm
in al, 0x21                 ; save pic1 mask
mov cl, al
in al, 0xA1                 ; save pic2 mask
mov ch, al

[…] ; initialization

mov al, cl
out 0x21, al                  ; restore pic1 mask
mov al, ch
out 0xA1, al                  ; restore pic2 mask
```

---
# PIC Initialization

```nasm
mov al, 0x11
out 0x20, al        ; `send initialize command` to pic1
out 0xA0, al        ; send initialize command to pic2

mov al, 0x20
out 0x21, al        ; `set vector offset` of pic1 to 0x20
mov al, 0x28
out 0xA1, al        ; set vector offset of pic2 to 0x28

mov al, 4
out 0x21, al        ; tell pic1 that there is a slave PIC at IRQ2 (0000 0100)
mov al, 2
out 0xA1, al        ; tell pic2 its cascade identity (0000 0010)

mov al, 0x1
out 0x21, al        ; 8086 mode for pic1
out 0xA1, al        ; 8086 mode for pic2
```

---
# PIC Usage

- Enable interrupts through the `sti` instruction
- Now there should be regular timer interrupts
  - With interrupt vector `0x20` .grey[(pic1 vector offset + 0)]
- Interrupts must be acknowledged
  - By sending an _end of interrupt_ (EOI) signal to master pic
  - If interrupt from slave: Also send EOI to slave pic
  ```nasm
  mov al, 0x20    ; EOI code
  out 0x20, al    ; send EOI to master
  out 0xa0, al    ; send EOI to slave
  ```

---
# PIC: Timer Configuration

To set an interval of 10ms (100Hz):

```nasm
mov rcx, 1193180/100    ; divisor (100 Hz)

mov al, 0x36
out 0x43, al            ; set channel 0 data register + mode bits

mov al, cl
out 0x40, al            ; set low divisor byte

mov al, ch
out 0x40, al            ; set high divisor byte
```

---
# PIC: Summary

- Simple way to get timer interrupts
  - Fixed interval
  - Also: keyboard interrupts
- For more details see [randomhacks.net](http://www.randomhacks.net/2015/11/16/bare-metal-rust-configure-your-pic-interrupts/) and [osdev.org](http://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC)
- `pic8259_simple` crate available on crates.io

# Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller

.center[![](apic.png)]

.grey[(from the [.grey[AMD64 manual]](http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/24593_APM_v21.pdf))]

---
# APIC Configuration

- Memory-mapped configuration registers
- Enable by setting the _spurious interrupt vector register_
- Mask all interrupts in the legacy PIC
- Also remap the PIC IRQs
  - Spurious interrupts are still possible
  - Without remapping, they are interpreted as exceptions

---
# Multitasking: Principles

.grey[- Multiple threads of execution
  - Each thread requires its own stack
- Switch between threads, so that all make progress
  - A _scheduler_ decides which thread runs next]


## Preemptive Scheduling

.grey[- Set up a hardware timer
  - Sends an _interrupt_ after specific time]
- CPU invokes interrupt handler .grey[(defined in the IDT)]
  - Calls _dispatcher_ to perform thread switch
      - Calls scheduler to select next thread

---
# Multitasking: Dispatching

- Save all general purpose registers on the stack
- (Save SSE/floating point state)
- Save stack pointer value in a thread control block
  - Required to continue thread

--


- Call scheduler to select next thread
- Load stack pointer from next thread's TCB
  - Must be done in assembly

--


- Restore register state from stack
- For userspace threads: Switch address space
- Continue execution

---
# Dispatching Example: Timer Interrupt Handler

```rust
extern "x86-interrupt" fn timer_handler(f: &ExceptionStackFrame) {
    unsafe {
        asm!("mov rdi, rsp
              call schedule
              mov rsp, rax"
              ::: "rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, …, r15" : "intel");
    }
}

fn schedule(sp: usize) -> usize {
    SCHEDULER.lock().schedule(sp)
}
```

---
# Dispatching Example: Timer Interrupt Handler

```rust
struct Scheduler {
    threads: VecDeque<usize>,
}

impl Scheduler {
    fn schedule(&mut self, sp: usize) -> usize {
        self.threads.push_back(sp);
        self.threads.pop_front().unwrap()
    }

    fn create_thread(&mut self, sp: usize, ip: usize) {
        […] // construct interrupt stack frame on stack
        self.threads.push_back(sp_new);
    }
}
```

---
# Multitasking: Scheduler Design

- Cheap to compute
- Ensure fairness .grey[of some kind]
  - e.g. equalize run-time in recent history
- Scalable


- Priorities?
  - Avoid priority inversion!
- Multi-processor support?
- Real-Time guarantees?

---
# Multitasking: Simple Scheduler Designs

- Round-Robin
  - `Vec` of threads
  - Simplest case: `Vec` of stack pointers
- Priority queue using `BinaryHeap`?
- Fixed time-slice lengths
- Pre-allocated memory for real-time guarantees

# Case Study: The OSv Scheduler

- Tick-less
  - No periodic timer interrupts
  - Use high resolution clock instead
    - Set a timer for the next thread switch time
- Fairness: exponentially-decaying moving average
- Completely lock-free

<br><br>.grey[(see [.grey[the paper]](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-kivity.pdf) for more details)]
---
# The OSv Scheduler: Lock-Freedom

- No mutexes, no spinlocks
- Separate run-queue per CPU
- Load balancer for migration between CPUs
- `N` lock-free SPSC queues of incoming threads per CPU
  - `N^2` SPSC queues in total
  - Inter-processor interrupt for notification of new content
- Optimization: Bitmap of non-empty queues per CPU

.grey[(`N` = number of CPUs)<br>
(SPSC = “single producer, single consumer”)]

---
# Case Study: Real Time For the Masses

- Idea: Each task belongs to an interrupt
- Scheduling is done by interrupt controller
  - Invokes interrupt handlers highest-priority first
  - Preempts low-priority tasks on higher priority IRQs


- Same-priority tasks can't preempt each other
- Task have _run to completion_ semantics
  - Endless loops cause starvation of lower-priority tasks

More info: http://blog.japaric.io/fearless-concurrency/

---
# RTFM Example

```rust
tasks!(stm32f30x, {
    periodic: Task {
        interrupt: Tim7,
        priority: P1,
        enabled: true,
    },
});

fn periodic(mut task: Tim7, ref priority: P1, ref threshold: T1) {
    // Task local data
    static STATE: Local<bool, Tim7> = Local::new(false);

    let state = STATE.borrow_mut(&mut task);
    *state = !*state;
    if *state { LEDS[0].on(); } else { LEDS[0].off(); }
}
```

---
# Multitasking: Summary

- Dispatcher saves/restores thread state .grey[(on stack)]
- Scheduler chooses next thread
  - Tradeoff: good decision <-> fast decision
- Preemption through hardware timer
  - PIC and Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)
  - APIC with integrated timer

Scheduler design ideas:

- OSv: lock-free scheduling
- RTFM: real-time scheduling with priorities
  - Interrupt controller is scheduler
